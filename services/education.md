# Education

Developer Relations helps people make computers "do a thing."

> Software development is a learning job. Developers are constantly having to learn new things. They read before writing. Give them code. Let them predict what it'll do. Le them run it and observe what it did. Inspire them to modify and change it. Let them make mistakes. Help them make something of their own.
> 
> Learning is a journey into the unknown. It's a vulnerable place for developers to be. Never underestimate that.
