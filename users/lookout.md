# Lookout

Innovation Teams and Architectural functions contain curious people, seeking out new technologies that may meet known or imagined business needs.  They are hunters and scouts, looking at the technical landscape, wanting to get enough information to allow those back home to decide whether it’s worth despatching Knights to learn more.


## Profile

### Balance

I want to do the right things. That's it!

### Ambition

I'm fascinated by cool stuff. I want to be recognised as the person who found it, sold it internally, and won.

### Skill

As a hobbyist, I like to tinkle with stuff - but the big idea matters than the big implementation.

### Influence

My heart is on big influence across my organization and out into the wide world.

### Challenges

* What's the future? Are you in it?
* Is it cool? Is what I think is cool what you think is cool?
* Does solve a business problem that I care about?
