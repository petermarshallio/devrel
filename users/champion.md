# Champion

I'm on a personal mission to establish my organization as deeply innovative / an early adopter / a builder of revolutionary and cool stuff.

I have personal goals to be famous for being deeply brilliant. I talk about my org's use cases and how they use the technology to solve business problems. And why it is that I was a pivotal part of it.

When I move to other places, I want to repeat my success. I'm a person that will influence people around me to re-use and re-purpose because I've seen and felt success with my own two hands.

I talk about revolutions in technology.
