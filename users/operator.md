# Operator

I'm a caretaker, expected to keep the system working.  I have to make sure the tools used meet all non-functional requirements, such as availability, response time, compliance, disaster recovery, and interoperability.

I'm particularly interested in the architecture of the solution so that I can keep it running against the SLAs and OLAs.

I know the risk and overhead of operating entire systems - including open source - so I'm often a catalyst for conversion as I experience first hand the need for customer success.


## Profile

### Balance

My focus is on the business. I don't really have a passion for discovering new cool things to play with.

### Ambition

I want things to be doing things right, not necessarily whether we're doing the right things.

### Skill

I care about whether the system works more than I do about the minute details. I'm an apprentice in a lot of things.

### Influence

I'm very influential because the business look to me for things to work. But will I go on a stand? Maybe not.

### Challenges

* Will this new system introduce risk?
* This isn't the only thing I have to look after. Don't create more problems for me!

### Satisfaction

* Stability through education.
* Understanding of dependency in the ecosystem.
* Operational visibility.

## Potential

* Technical content writer
