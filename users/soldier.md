# The soldier

While I might start out using X because I’ve taken it on advisement, I may also have been motivated to pick up more knowledge.  My mix of skills enable me to complete DevOps work that delivers releases.

I do not have a budget - I have a problem to solve.

I am not necessarily thinking about what people want: I just want to get from A to B in the quickest possible manner.

I'm an early adopter, I'm willing to experiment. Generally scan, but when something attracts my attention, I’m willing to go deep.

I have a mix of skills that may include programming / software development, software design, data modelling and design, real-time / embedded systems development, analytics, visualisation, testing, and UX design.
