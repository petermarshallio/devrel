# Knight

I design and am actively curious about technical solutions for business problems, aiming to create solutions that meet known and unknown needs. I care about building blocks, prototyping and testing to build out recommendations to the business based on formal and personal assessments of what is “good fit”.

The company’s entire toolset needs to be a benefit to the whole company – the cost and the value delivered must be well-balanced, and risks minimised.  I encourage participation in IT decisions to maximise utility across the business and is interoperable with other ecosystem components, avoiding costly technical diversification and proliferation.

Tools need to be compliant and support business continuity and warranty requirements. I want to protect the company's IP and its data, ensuring data can be added with confidence, has integrity and is adequately protected while stored, is accessible to those that need it, and can be effectively disposed of.

I am a trusted advisor with a commercial head on my shoulders. I have a finger on the pulse of business and technology, having a voice in strategic planning and in defining functional and nonfunctional requirements, often being a technical expert / senior supplier in projects (e.g. POCs, M&A).

I'm listened to when anyone suggests some tech could ease pain, and whether it could replace, displace, or augment existing technology, whether that’s for the business as a whole, a physical location, or specific business function or service. That often means I have strong working relationship with Business Analysts, Service Transition, and other internal architects.

## Profile

We need to do the right things.

### Ambition

I want to build a better business by having the right technology. I'm here to tell you whether a design is going to work for our customers.

### Skill

I know what the value is that things provide. I'm not really here to get my hands dirty as a master in one or other technology.

### Influence

My influence stretches out across the organization and I can speak confidently to organizations with similar problems.

### Challenges

* How do I communicate what I learn with other architects?
* What's the quickest route to understanding the value add to the architecture?
* Who should be involved when something is being designed?
* Do I need to sell this internally? How?
* When should I get compliance approval and budget for “ideas”?
* How does this fit into the my knowledge of the whole tech landscape?
* Who else in the business can benefit from this thing?
* What's the operational risk? What's the overhead?
* Does this align with my other architectural designs?
* Why is no-one looking at my sweet diagrams?
