# Personas

> Developers must MASLOW before they can BLOOM. Enable understanding, give them confidence, encourage connection, give them power, and give them agency.

Over time, developers become concerned with the operation of a system. The majority of the probles, requests, and questions they ask are operational. They write about operating the software.

Depending on the size of the company they work for, they could be in operator mode OR in developer mode by role or just because it's that time of the day...
