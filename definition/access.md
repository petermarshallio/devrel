# DevRel access strategy

Design an access strategy for your company. Something something something darkside.

## Synchronous versus asynchronous delivery

__Synchronous channels__ are in a specific place, at a specific time. There's immediate feedback and interaction, and opportunity for relationship making.

It might be a place where people can therefore go deep.

Sometimes these are not personalized channels - it can feel like this is about broad audiences, and not the needs of individuals.

__Asynchronous channels__ are accessed on demand whenever needed. They enable self-paced consumption - so they're great for the cool kids.

Accessing these requires awareness, ease of access, and a great deal of curiosity and self-motivation.

## Layers of the cake

Channels change the deeper you get to the implementation details of your product - ie, the code.

You might layer this as follows:

* Intrigue - what is this thing?
* Self help - how do I use feature X?
* Experience - how do I solve for problem X?
* Facts - what's the system actually doing?
* Investigation - why is it doing that?
* Development - how do I change what it does?

### Intrigue

Examples:

* Booths
* Talks
* Slack
* Forums
* Social media (X, LinkedIn)
* Newsletters
* Posts
* Powered By / Use cases
* YouTube Channel front page

### Self help

* Schedulable clinics
* Stack overflow, Reddit Q&A
* General drop-ins
* Special interest groups and squads
* Themed events
* YouTube Channel playlists
* Cookbooks
* Themed articles

### Experience

* Training courses
* Lightning labs
* Online forums and knowledgebases
* Feature featurette presentations and demos
* Tutorials and notebooks

### Facts

* Deep tech talks
* Deep explainer videos - "under the covers"
* Documentation

### Investigation

* Slack engineering channels
* Developer mailing lists

### Development

* GitHub issues
* GitHub PRs
* Committer and contributor meetups
* Engineer get-togethers
