# Inspiration

We encourage people to tell one another about how cool they are, for example, by sharing their use case, or demonstrating an app they’ve built on top of our technology.  We create – and encourage other people to create – both emotive and rational content that both raises awareness and eases adoption.

By encouraging people to tell inspirational stories, we directly encourage growth of the install base by associating it with real success stories ([Product / Market Competitive Positioning](https://slidebazaar.com/items/content-marketing-matrix-template-for-powerpoint-keynote/)).  Use case cross-pollination isn’t just important between organisations – it’s also important internally: it can happen when more people inside a company know that it’s available as a service.

And through engagement, we increase retention by supporting people to speak up and be recognised for their work, to feel proud.  And with more and more use cases in a particular vertical, we put our stamp on that vertical strongly and give people confidence.
