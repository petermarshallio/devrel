# Observation

A community needs to understand itself, gathering and sharing intelligence, in order to remain healthy.  By making it conscious of places that it needs to get better, it can respond to threats, identify risks, and do something about damage.

Being caretakers of the health of the community generates growth as we give people clear and direct actions to take to become active, enabling them to be so.

We’re also able to retain by creates a sense of personal ownership for the project in a range of activities and to see off early challenges by assessing effort required for engagements – but giving people a route to make that less risky with clear action plans.

In addition it helps our employers to identify and acquire good talent, and build its reputation as a community builder

## DevRel skillset

We use [Competency Assessment](https://sfia-online.org/en/sfia-8/skills/competency-assessment) – along with other skills – to understand – and then watch out for – specific signals and events that occur as people traverse their own journey in the community of developers, giving us a view of the health and vibrancy of the community of developers across the world, driving greater maturity – especially in organisations that can be role models for others. 

That helps us to improve the veracity and velocity of the community, to make tactical plans to increase the maturity of key accounts, to map out internal influencing required to improve our own maturity, to validate our personal and team goals and to benchmark individuals, organisations, and regions using metrics.
