# Voice

Watching out for opportunities for developers to have their voice heard, whether that’s an idea for functionality, or a security problem that needs to be fixed.

Whereas [innovation](./maturity-innovation.md) is concerned with adaptations within the user base inspired by technology, _voice_ concerns adaptations in technology inspired by users.  We advocate on their behalf rationally and reasonably so that everyone benefits.

When people have a voice and it’s heard, we facilitate growth and retain customers by aligning our own commercial roadmap and open source contributions to the real needs of individuals that will lead to overall success for the community. And the data that allows us to do that tells us more about what the overall needs are out there in the wide world.
