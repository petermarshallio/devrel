# Shared enterprise

We are passionate about advancing the technology we use, sharing goals that [altruists](../users/altruist.md) (who were probably [soldiers](../users/soldier.md) themselves once) can work towards together (e.g. new functionality, fixes, and docs updates), praising those that helped achieve them (e.g. the contributors), and amplifying their work so people know about what they’ve done and who they are.

Particularly for open source projects, we are respectful. We _never_ exert undue influence.

This is invaluable for growth as it allows us to access a 24-hour, global, highly-skilled pool of resources, inspiring them to exercise good will for the good of the technology.

Participation inspires retention as people feel “I helped make that!” and receive praise and recognition for their efforts.

|---------------------	|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| 1 - ISOLATED        	| Having downloaded or signed up to our tech, they only very rarely look at the code itself.  Being consumers, they takes no part in repo discussions, and have probably neither starred it nor forked it.                                                                                                                                                                                                 	|
| 2 - DEPENDENT       	| Developers report security issues without hesitation, [[QU30](https://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html#:~:text=The%20Apache%20Project%20Maturity%20Model%20provides%20a%20suggested,these%20factors%20apply%20to%20any%20open%20source%20project.)] and may create code-related Github Issues when they’d like to have something changed.  Their interaction is limited to describing the effects it has on them, and not on the community at large.                                                                                                                                                    	|
| 3 - CONTRIBUTING    	| Actively participates in testing issues reported on Github but only if they impact them directly.  They help to find the root cause and may propose code-level changes [[QU50](https://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html#:~:text=The%20Apache%20Project%20Maturity%20Model%20provides%20a%20suggested,these%20factors%20apply%20to%20any%20open%20source%20project.)]. Code contributions benefit only users of their local fork. May reference issues or requests reported in Github when asking for help.                                                                                              	|
| 4 - PARTICIPATING   	| Developers push regular, valuable contributions to code in response to issues [[CO30](https://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html#:~:text=The%20Apache%20Project%20Maturity%20Model%20provides%20a%20suggested,these%20factors%20apply%20to%20any%20open%20source%20project.)] that affect other people in the community.  They are fully engaged in all manner of discussions around proposed changes, and in coaching other people to make high-quality contributions. Along with references to docs, issues, and requests, people answering questions might make explicit reference to underlying code. 	|
| 5 - SELF-ORGANIZING 	| Developers, now committers, are passionate about making the technology better and stronger.  They participate in decision-making in the project [[CO60](https://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html#:~:text=The%20Apache%20Project%20Maturity%20Model%20provides%20a%20suggested,these%20factors%20apply%20to%20any%20open%20source%20project.)] free of organizational influence [[IN10](https://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html#:~:text=The%20Apache%20Project%20Maturity%20Model%20provides%20a%20suggested,these%20factors%20apply%20to%20any%20open%20source%20project.)] and in an independent capacity. They spend time caring for tools and processes that support high-quality releases.                                                                                                         	|
