# Innovation

We encourage experimentation, engineering, writing, demonstrating, and speaking – anything that resonate with architects and senior developers, e.g. reference designs, data architectures, inspiring experiments, libraries of architectural artifacts (such as diagrams, tables, and matrices), and template presentations – anything that describes the functions and services of our technology and how they can be used by the business to deliver value.  

All this to bolster the global case for prioritising, incubating, and exploiting opportunities afforded by using our tech.

We work with marketing to find the best digital and physical channels to maximise the number of people we reach and the relevance of our content to them.  Contributing "marketable content" can be shared and reused.

This pillar creates growth by encouraging people to download and try our tech, making it relevant in the face of a known risk / threat, and in the dreamworld – and by providing existing champions the information they need to identify different needs that Druid could meet elsewhere, speaking “value to pain”, building products that meets user needs and solve people’s pain faster; we increase the reach and relevance of “data” about our tech.

Generating curiosity is a key value-add; it breeds enticement across the addressable market, and seeing our own employer, impressions for our own content overall increases as we write more about how to use our tech to alleviate more pain.

And by involving more people in generating highly-technical material, we increase activity.

It supports retention goals by elevating the people that produce relevant and re-usable technical material for as long as they remain part of the community.

| 1 - ISOLATED        	| Does not feel that the community is a source of reliable, relatable expertise, relying entirely on personal experimentation to find answers instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         	|
| 2 - DEPENDENT       	| Developers rely on pre-packaged content, or create it themselves for themselves.  They share the content locally on a need to know basis in order to drive forward a specific project – e.g. during technology selection.  This so that they know how to adapt their own technology and processes. They elicit, specify, and document requirements within a clearly-defined, highly-localised scope – perhaps just one project or business area – and apply what they know about our tech only to those requirements.                                                                                           	|
| 3 - CONTRIBUTING    	| Leading innovation across a broad number of use cases, these developers encourage and motivate innovation, sharing the content widely. They facilitate communication between creative people to drive innovation, commenting on content they have found, praising the authors, and giving feedback on its style and accuracy. Now, they are aware of a broader range of needs that our technology meets, able to understand how they apply in a range of different, more complex, use cases.  They can make the important connection between those needs and the people that they will actually help by meeting them. 	|
| 4 - PARTICIPATING   	| Now thinking about the long-term needs of those around them, they proactively adapt and producing content to drive innovation using our technology.  They write on a broad range of topics and in many different media and contribute these back to the community. They share content that stimulates interest amongst a larger range of personas from a broad range of use cases, contributing content that states specifically how our tech can help them be heroes.  Amongst these stakeholders, they’re seen as a thought leader and a partner for success.                                                   	|
| 5 - SELF-ORGANIZING 	| These champions encourage the community at large to contribute to innovation-supporting material, connecting people based on their shared passion for, and understanding of, how to innovate with Druid and the needs that it meets.  They are likely to have created guidelines for good content, and give advice on how to use materials and who they ought to be shared with in what context, and have brought together stakeholders in a broad context to openly share what they need and where our technologies help.                                                                                             	|
