# What is DevRel?

__Forging relationships.__

__Creating champions.__

We're here throughout the journey - from inspiration to production, from production to participation, from participation to inspiration.

* Attraction - telling people there's a cool place to be
* Awareness - pulling people into, and welcoming them to, the party
* Assessment - giving them all they need when considering to apply technologies
* Adoption - being there as they create something magical
* Activation - driving communities to help each other
* Application - staying friends when their system is operational
* Advocacy - helping people celebrate their success publicly

We're here to make that journey successful.

* We bring definition, we know the features, we know how it works.
* We know how to learn - not just what to learn.
* We talk about technology in a way and with a language that they understand. And we are not evil.
* We mentor. We tutor.
* We care enough to track people and what they're doing. But we are not evil.
* We know that, at some point, things might get risky. Because we care about them, we know there are services and products they can buy. But we are not salespeople.
