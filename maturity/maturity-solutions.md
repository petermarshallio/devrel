# Solutions

This pillar is critical to growth and retention in the community as it directly makes it easier for people to incubate, release, and operate Apache Druid, including Imply customers at every stage of their journey with us.

In particular, it helps us retain people on the journey by seeing off issues that they might have, and by increasing the confidence that they have.  And by giving people more skills, they feel personal ownership for the technology, building up a weight of wisdom that minimises the impact of any knowledge loss occurring if an individual leaves.

Regarding growth, this pillar creates leads as people register for forums and see adverts there for our company's products and other sponsored community tools.  And through one-to-one conversation between peers when troubleshooting particularly difficult problems, we look like the experts, and become internal referrers for Leads ourselves.

We create relationships out of our interactions to create more mentors who will help and inspire people throughout their adoption journey.

|---------------------	|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| 1 - ISOLATED        	| Sees no value in using any of the community’s forums to ask questions, instead relying on their own experience and research to resolve problems and answer questions.                                                                                                                                                                  	|
| 2 - DEPENDENT       	| They raise questions and problems for the community to respond to, but require a lot of hand-holding.  They hardly ever respond to other people’s questions. They might raise issues when documentation fails them, but there is little attempt to go further.                                                                         	|
| 3 - CONTRIBUTING    	| Developers answer questions and provide solutions to problems around topics in which they have experience and skill or hold a vested interest [[CO70](https://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html#:~:text=The%20Apache%20Project%20Maturity%20Model%20provides%20a%20suggested,these%20factors%20apply%20to%20any%20open%20source%20project.)]. Very often, responses include links to docs – and they are participants in discussions around them.                                                                              	|
| 4 - PARTICIPATING   	| Advanced developers answer questions and help solve problems on a wide range of services and functions.  They have wisdom that makes them a source of best practice, and they share them in lots of ways in lots of places. They very often contribute changes to docs, engaging in conversations about how the update should be made. 	|
| 5 - SELF-ORGANIZING 	| They spot patterns and trends in issues, questions, and problems, and have begun to discuss their findings openly. They are actively working to build and improve tools and processes the community uses to answer questions and solve problems. Very likely, they are a committer because of their work on documentation.             	|

## DevRel skillset

We use skills in [Application Support](https://sfia-online.org/en/sfia-8/skills/application-support), [Problem Management](https://sfia-online.org/en/sfia-8/skills/problem-management), [Specialist Advice](https://sfia-online.org/en/sfia-8/skills/specialist-advice), [Knowledge Management](https://sfia-online.org/en/sfia-8/skills/knowledge-management), [Methods and tools](https://sfia-online.org/en/sfia-8/skills/methods-and-tools) so that users can demonstrate value upwards out of their applications, databases, data sources, and infrastructure.  We forge inspirational environments where together users find answers to technical questions, where they confidently carry out research under the covers (sometimes at code level) to find root causes and identify solutions, and where their requests for fixes from developers have depth and clarity.  We are role models wherever people are asking questions or have problems, in person or online.
