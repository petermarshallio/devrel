# Skill

Developing wisdom by making knowledge an experience, we elevate every developer, whether a [soldier](../users/soldier.md) or [caretaker](../users/caretaker.md), from an apprentice (personal learning) to a master (trusted advisor) of our technology

Anyone can find practical guidance on the technology and its ecosystem, using environments that make learning and adoption easy.

It’s important to note that not everyone completes a course that they enroll for.  They might start a course only to think they do not have the prerequisite knowledge, may start but find the answer to their specific question mid-way through a course, might feel that they’re covering ground they already know and stop, or may just feel that it’s become too much of a commitment.  For this reason, one of our tactics is to create bitesize content that is fast and easy to consume.

| Level               	| Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          	|
|---------------------	|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| 1 - ISOLATED        	| Developers attempt to learn on their own, relying on experimentation and a cursory reference to videos and other people’s experiences.                                                                                                                                                                                                              	|
| 2 - DEPENDENT       	| They enrol in schemes and look at websites that provide information they need to learn how to be successful with Druid. Feedback is one-way –participants don’t engage in activities to improve tutorials, labs, or courses as part of the broader community.                                                                                       	|
| 3 - CONTRIBUTING    	| Actively pursuing education about our technology, developers promote educational materials and pathways to other people. They participate in conversations about what tutorials they need and in making suggestions about how they can be improved based on their own knowledge, not just of how things work, but of why things matter.                      	|
| 4 - PARTICIPATING   	| Participating fully in the creation and delivery of training material, developers also play an active part in creating that material and in designing a curriculum that meets their and other people’s needs. Tutorials are contributed freely on a range of topics in which they have experience, and proactively look for feedback on their work. 	|
| 5 - SELF-ORGANIZING 	|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     	|
