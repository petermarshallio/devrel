# People

Everyone can be involved in the community, no matter who they work for, study with, or their contract with our employer.  By connecting people together on a similar stage of their journey, with people who share common needs and interests, or even just people who live near them, the community’s network grows in compassion, courage, and resilience.

By better understanding people we can assess growth potential by measuring the overall opportunity size and associated company revenues of companies. And by knowing people better –in the same way as Apache see individual participants rather than “employees” – we can expand inside and embed into more organisations, increasing recommendations made by word-of-mouth.

We are also able to increase retention as we get to know more people, de-risking accounts away from superheroes.

## DevRel skillset

As a team, we use [Stakeholder Relationship Management](https://sfia-online.org/en/sfia-8/skills/stakeholder-relationship-management), [User experience analysis](https://sfia-online.org/en/sfia-8/skills/user-experience-analysis), and [Consultancy](https://sfia-online.org/en/sfia-8/skills/consultancy) to maintain a view of the developer personas and where they live and work, allowing us to understand the needs of the global developer community and how we can help.  This doesn’t just mean meeting and talking to people, it also means surveys and short questionnaires, and analysis of all sorts of data, from configuration files to the types of questions people ask and the problems they have.
